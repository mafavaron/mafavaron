- 👋 Hi, I’m Patrizia Favaron (@mafavaron)
- 👀 I’m interested in the physics of lower atmosphere and, as developer, in building measurement systems dedicated to the environment and building environmental data processing libraries and applications.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning the language Julia, advanced use of modern Fortran, and of course, more physics.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on environmental data processing projects, with a special attention to micro-meteorology and micro-climatology.
- 📫 You can reach me at my e-mail, patti.favaron@gmail.com
